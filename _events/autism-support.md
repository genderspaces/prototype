### Before you come

You'll need to [contact us](error.html) to book an appointment before you can come.

Before your first appointment, you might want to write a list ahead of time with any questions you want to ask at your appointment. You can bring this with you to help you remember things. You can also email a copy to us in advance so we can make sure we have answers to your questions. If you're not sure what you want to ask, or you just want to talk to us, that's okay - we can help you think about things at your appointment.

If you want to plan how you are getting to us ahead of time, there is information about public transport and parking on the [venue information page](/venue/ncas).

Let us know if you need to visit the venue in advance for any reason.
